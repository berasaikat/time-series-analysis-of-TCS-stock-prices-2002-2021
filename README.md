# Time Series Analysis of TCS Stock Prices from 2002 to 2021
In the report ['Analysis Report 1'](https://github.com/berasaikat/time-series-analysis-of-tcs-stock-prices-2004-2021/blob/main/Analysis%20Report%201.ipynb) I have performed a time series analysis of the stock prices of Tata Consultancy Services from 2002 to 2021. I have started by visualising the data. And then I fitted models like ***an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, Vector autoregression (VAR), SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA) model, Unobserved components model (UCM), and Dynamic Factor models***. I also calculated the root mean square error of all the models and plotted the residual diagnostics.
